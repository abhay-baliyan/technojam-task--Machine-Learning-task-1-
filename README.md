# technojam-task--Machine-Learning-task-1-
Hi im Abhay Baliyan. I have some basic experience in C,C++,java,Python. I also have some basic understanding of AI-ML as i have done an training / internship of it during last summer break. <br>
I completed the task - 1 in which i had to first import numpy,matplotlib,pandas packages, after that i had to upload the dataset on google collab and then i had to split dataset into train and test sets, then i performed linear regression and after that i plotted a standard graph between open and last colomn of the given data set.
